# `filesha1` Function

`filesha1` is a variant of [`sha1`](/language/functions/sha1)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `sha1(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](/language/functions/file) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
